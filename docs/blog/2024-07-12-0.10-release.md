The `0.10` release brings with it significant performance and reliability improvements. <!-- truncate -->

## New Features

### Reliability during Rebalances

PR [#872](https://github.com/littlehorse-enterprises/littlehorse/pull/872) improves the user experience of LittleHorse 

### Rescue Failed Workflows

PR [#883](https://github.com/littlehorse-enterprises/littlehorse/pull/883) allows users to restart failed `WfRun`'s via the `lhctl rescue` command. This is similar to allowing a user to execute mutating SQL queries via a CLI like `psql`.

With this feature, a user can fix a buggy Task Worker implementation and then restart a failed `WfRun` and get it to execute the failed `TaskRun` again via:

```
lhctl rescue <wfRunId> <threadRunNumber>
```

### mTLS Principals

Previously, only listeners of the type `OAUTH` supported `Principal`s. The `Principal` ID was determined by the OAuth Client ID or User Id. Release `0.10` introduces the ability to infer a `Principal` on an `MTLS` listener, where the `Principal` ID comes from the 

PR [#874](https://github.com/littlehorse-enterprises/littlehorse/pull/874) by one of our newer team members, [Jacob Snarr](https://github.com/snarr), introduced this feature.

### Dashboard Enhancements

The `0.10` release includes multiple enhancements to the Admin Dashboard, including:

* Ability to search for `WfRun`'s by their variables.
* Improved `WfRun` search.
* Fixed display of `TaskRun`s with the `EXCEPTION` and `ERROR` status.
* Showing `VariableMutation`s on the `Edge` in the dashboard.

## What's Next?

We will need one more minor release before finally releasing `1.0`. We need the following:

* Upgrade `org.apache.kafka:kafka-streams` to `3.8.0` to address several critical reliability bugs (we are waiting for the official release).
* Conduct new load tests and soak tests against the new version of Kafka Streams.
* Review our Go and Python SDK's in-depth to ensure proper semantics.

After that, we will be ready to commit to the backwards compatibility guarantees required by [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). We will also release a blog post with our planned release schedule and support schedule.
