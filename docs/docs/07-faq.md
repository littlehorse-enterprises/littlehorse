# Tips, Pointers, and FAQ

We do our best to make our documentation easy to navigate; however, LittleHorse has a lot of features and it may not always be easy to find what you are looking for.

Think of this page as an "index" that will help you find what you need to make your project a success.

## Workflow Basics

Read here for how to get started.

### What is a `WfSpec` and `WfRun`?

The core concept of LittleHorse is a [Workflow](./04-concepts/01-workflows.md), which defines a series of tasks to execute and events to wait for. A `WfSpec` defines a workflow specification. A `WfRun` is a running instance of that `WfSpec`.
workflow specification is the configuration, or metadata object, that tells the engine what Tasks to run,
what order to run the tasks,
**how to handle exceptions or failures,**
what variables are to be passed from task to task,
and what inputs and outputs are required to run the workflow.

In LittleHorse the Workflow Spec is submitted to and held by the LittleHorse server.
It is a written in Code, using the LittleHorse SDK.  
In the background LittleHorse server takes the submitted spec from the SDK, and compiles a protobuf object that is submitted to the LittleHorse server.
<!-- TODO: simpler example -->
Example:
```declarative
public class QuickstartWorkflow {

    public static final String WF_NAME = "quickstart";
    public static final String GREET = "greet";

    /*
     * This method defines the logic of our workflow
     */
    public void quickstartWf(WorkflowThread wf) {
        // Create an input variable, make it searchable
        WfRunVariable name = wf.addVariable("input-name", VariableType.STR).searchable();

        // Execute a task and pass in the variable.
        wf.execute(GREET, name);
    }

    /*
     * This method returns a LittleHorse `Workflow` wrapper object that can be
     * used to register the WfSpec to the LH Server.
     */
    public Workflow getWorkflow() {
        return Workflow.newWorkflow(WF_NAME, this::quickstartWf);
    }
}
```
### How do I create a `WfSpec`?

Check out our [`WfSpec` development docs](./05-developer-guide/08-wfspec-development/08-wfspec-development.md)! In short, you can use our Java, Python, or Go SDK's to define the `WfSpec` logic and then register them to the LH Server.

### Tasks
Tasks are the unit of work for a work flow engine.  
It's best to think in examples:
* Change lower case letters to upper case letters.
* Call an API with an input variable and pass along the output.
* Wait for user input or an event to happen.

### What is a Task Worker?

A [Task Worker](./04-concepts/03-tasks.md) is a program that opens a connection to a LittleHorse Cluster and listens to a task queue for a specific `TaskDef`. When a `WfRun` arrives at a point where it needs to execute that specific type of `TaskRun`, then the scheduled Task will be dispatched to the Task Worker. The Task Worker executes it and reports the result to the LH Server.

A task worker can be a bare metal machine, Virtual Machine, cloud instance, Kubernetes pod, or anywhere that can execute Java/Python/Golang or C# code.

### How do I write a Task Worker?

Check out our [Task Worker Development Docs](./05-developer-guide/05-task-worker-development.md)!

### How do I run a Workflow?

You can run a workflow in two ways:
* On the command line by [using `lhctl`](./05-developer-guide/03-lhctl.md#run-a-wfrun).  This method is best suited for testing, development, or debugging.
* Programmatically by [using one of our SDK's](./05-developer-guide/09-grpc/10-running-workflows.md).  Under the covers, the SDKs call the GRPC endpoint on the LittleHorse server.  Programmatic execution is ideal for incorporating into your dashboards, and operational tools.

## Variables and Control Flow

### How do I pass information from one task to another?

Variables are how you pass info from one task to another. Take the output of one task and `ASSIGN` it to a variable, then pass that variable into the next task. Check out our [mutating variables documentation](./05-developer-guide/08-wfspec-development/03-mutating-variables.md).

### How do I define variables in a Workflow?

Check out the [Variables Section](./05-developer-guide/08-wfspec-development/01-basics.md#defining-variables) of our `WfSpec` docs.

### Can I search for workflows by their variables?

Yes, you can. To do that, [mark the variable as `searchable()`](./05-developer-guide/08-wfspec-development/01-basics.md#searchable-and-required-variables) and then use [`rpc SearchVariable](./08-api.md#rpc-searchvariable) to search for it.

### How do I do if/else in a Workflow?

Check out the [Conditionals Section](./05-developer-guide/08-wfspec-development/02-conditionals.md) of our `WfSpec` docs.

### Can a workflow have loops?

Yes, check out the [loops section](./05-developer-guide/08-wfspec-development/02-conditionals.md#while-loops).

## External Events

### What is an `ExternalEvent`?

[External Events](./04-concepts/04-external-events.md) in LittleHorse represent events that occur outside of the context of a single `WfRun`. For example, you might use an `ExternalEvent` to notify a `WfRun` when someone signs a DocuSign document, or when a text message is replied to.

An `ExternalEvent` is an instance of an `ExternalEventDef`.

### How do I make a `WfRun` wait for an event?

Check out the [External Events](./05-developer-guide/08-wfspec-development/04-external-events.md) section of our `WfSpec` docs. What you want is an `ExternalEventNode`, which blocks until an `ExternalEvent` arrives.

### How do I interrupt a `WfRun`?

Check out the [Interrupts](./05-developer-guide/08-wfspec-development/05-interrupts.md) section of our `WfSpec` docs. What you want to do is register an Interrupt Handler for a certain `ExternalEventDef.`

### What happens when a `WfRun` is interrupted?

The interrupted `ThreadRun` is `HALTED`, and a child `ThreadRun` is created to act as the Interrupt Handler. For info, check out our [concept docs](./04-concepts/04-external-events.md#interrupts) and our [`WfSpec` development docs](./05-developer-guide/08-wfspec-development/05-interrupts.md).

You may want to interrupt a WfRun for various reasons including: A user cancels an order in on an e-commerce site,  A business request is Denied or an external API returns a back off or denied status. 
### How can I access the content of an `ExternalEvent` inside my workflow?

You can use the output of an `ExternalEventNode` just like any other node in our SDK. Check out [these docs](./05-developer-guide/08-wfspec-development/04-external-events.md#external-events#accessing-event-content)

### How do I post an `ExternalEvent`?

You need to know the `WfRunId` of the `WfRun` you want to notify, and you need to know the `ExternalEventDefId`.

### Can I make `ExternalEvent`s idempotent?

Yes, just pass the `guid` parameter in the `PutExternalEventRequest` when making the `rpc PutExternalEvent`.

## Workflow Threading

### Can I run tasks in parallel?

To run tasks in parallel within a single `WfRun`, you need to [create a Child Thread](./05-developer-guide/08-wfspec-development/07-child-threads.md).

### Can different threads share variables?

A child `ThreadRun` can read and write the variables of its parent. A parent cannot view the variables of its child.

### What happens when a child fails?

When a child fails, the failure propagates to the parent either at:
* The `WaitForThreadsNode`, or
* The `ExitNode`.

See the [Child Thread Docs](./05-developer-guide/08-wfspec-development/07-child-threads.md) for info on how to handle these failures.

### What happens to the child when a parent fails?

When a parent `ThreadRun` fails (`ERROR` or `EXCEPTION`) or moves to `HALTED`, the child will move to `HALTED`.

In order to recover from a failed Parent thread you can either catch the exception, and programmatically handle it.  Or require that a human restarts the workflow.
## User Tasks

### What are User Tasks?

[User Tasks](./04-concepts/05-user-tasks.md) allow a workflow to wait for input from a human.

### How do I add a user task to my workflow?

A `userTask` is to manage tasks involving humans alongside standard computer tasks in your LittleHorse Workflow.  Check out the [User Tasks](./05-developer-guide/08-wfspec-development/08-user-tasks.md) page of our `WfSpec` docs. 

### Do User Tasks support users and user groups?

Yes, user tasks can be assigned to either a user_id or a user_group. Note that user and group identities are not managed by the LH Server.  User and group identies are managed by an external identity provider(IDP), for example any oAUTH provider.

### How do I complete User Tasks?

For testing purposes, you can do it [using `lhctl`](./05-developer-guide/03-lhctl.md#usertaskrun). For production applications, check out our docs on [managing User Tasks with grpc](./05-developer-guide/09-grpc/20-user-tasks.md).

### How do I create a `UserTaskDef`?

Check out our [Managing Metadata docs](./05-developer-guide/09-grpc/05-managing-metadata.md#usertaskdef).

## Exception Handling

### What is the difference between `ERROR` and `EXCEPTION`?

As per our [Failure Handling Concepts Docs](./04-concepts/01-workflows.md#failure-handling), an `ERROR` represents a technical failure such as a type error, network outage, timeout, or unexpected exception thrown by a task worker. An `EXCEPTION` represents something going wrong _at the business process level_, such as an invalid credit card or an item being out of stock.

### How do I catch a failure in a workflow?

Check out our [Failure Handling `WfSpec` docs](./05-developer-guide/08-wfspec-development/06-exception-handling.md).

### How do I throw an `EXCEPTION`?

You can [throw an `EXCEPTION` from a Task Worker](./05-developer-guide/05-task-worker-development.md#throwing-workflow-exceptions). You can also make a `ThreadRun` fail with the `WorkflowThread.fail()` method.

## Reliability

### Is LittleHorse Fault-Tolerant?

Yes, it was built into the [core DNA of our system](./02-architecture-and-guarantees.md).  Every component of the LittleHorse tech stack is highly available and fault tolerant. At the workflow layer LittleHorse provides the primitives to handle faults in a way to suit the business needs.

### Does LittleHorse scale?

Yes, in our internal benchmarks a moderately resourced, single instance, of LittleHorse server can execute 30,000 tasks per second in a moderately complex workflow.

### How do I make Workflows idempotent?

You can [pass the `WfRunId`](./05-developer-guide/09-grpc/10-running-workflows.md#passing-the-id) when running a `WfRun`. Only one `WfRun` can exist with a given Id, so this makes the request idempotent.

### How do I make Tasks idempotent?

You can use the [`WorkerContext`](./05-developer-guide/05-task-worker-development.md#idempotence) to get an idempotency key.
