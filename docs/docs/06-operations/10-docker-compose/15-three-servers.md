# Three LittleHorse Orchestrators

LittleHorse is a horizontally scalable system. As such, you can configure multiple LittleHorse Orchestrator servers to act as a cluster. This provides the following benefits:

- High availability with hot standby replicas (note that durability is handled by Kafka and does not depend on the number of LittleHorse Servers).
- Higher throughput as work is distributed across multiple LittleHorse Servers.

This example shows how to run LittleHorse with three servers and a dashboard using Docker Compose without authentication.

## Docker Compose File

Save the following docker-compose file and run `docker compose up -d`.

```yaml

## Using the Example

Once you have created the LH Cluster using Docker Compose, the next step is to access it. For example, you can use one of our [quickstarts](../../05-developer-guide/00-install.md#get-started) with the following configurations.

The dashboard can be accessed at [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080).

You can connect to any of the three LittleHorse server instances in the cluster. In this example, the dashboard is configured to communicate with the server on port `2023`, but you could also connect with the servers on ports `2024` or `2025`.

### Worker Configs

Workers are configured when you create an `LHConfig` object according to [our documentation](../../05-developer-guide/02-client-configuration.md#creating-the-lhconfig). You need to pass in certain properties (either directly to the `LHConfig` constructor, through a `Properties` file, or through environment variables).

For this example, your workers should be configured as follows:

```
LHC_API_HOST=localhost

// You can address any of the three LittleHorse server ports
LHC_API_PORT=2023

LHW_SERVER_CONNECT_LISTENER=PLAIN
```

Even though your worker config only specifies one port to connect to via `LHC_API_PORT`, your workers will actually communicate with the entire cluster. This is because the Task Worker uses a discovery protocol in which it asks the bootstrap host (specified by `LHC_API_HOST` and `LHC_API_PORT`) for which servers to connect to in order to execute tasks.

:::tip
In production, it's recommended for your `LHC_API_HOST` and `LHC_API_PORT` to point to a load balancer that balances requests across all instances.

If you walk through our [quickstarts](../../05-developer-guide/00-install.md#get-started), the code in all three assumes that your configuration is set as environment variables.
