**As a** [description of user]
**I want to** [functionality]
**So that** [benefit]

**Context:**
Describe the context and any relevant information about this user story

**Acceptance Criteria:**
**Given** [how things begin]
**When** [action taken]
**Then** [outcome]

**Scope**
Allows to define what is within the scope of the user story and what’s not.

**Technical Context**
Here we need to specify if there are any technical constraints that might guide the implementation of the user story.
We MUST NOT provide technical details about the HOW, because every engineer is responsible for that.
Unless we consider our team mate is still in a phase where he/she has just joined the team and needs a really detailed context.
