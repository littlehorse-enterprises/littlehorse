# Reporting Security Bugs

If you find a non-security related bug, you may report it through a GitHub Issue or through our [Slack Community](https://launchpass.com/littlehorsecommunity). However, **for all security-related issues, do NOT open a GitHub issue.**

Instead, email a detailed report of the vulnerability to `security@littlehorse.io`.
