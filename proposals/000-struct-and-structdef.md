Author: Colt McNealy

We want schemas on the LH Server for several reasons:

* Add type safety to WfSpecâ€™s.
* Allow users of the upcoming _Output Topic_ feature to safely perform joins and transformations without worrying about type casting failures.
* Better developer experience.

We already have strong typing for primitive types (`INT`, `STR`, `DOUBLE`, `BOOL`). However, the `JSON_OBJ` and `JSON_ARR` fields are YOLO Wild West, which has caused problems and errors for our users.

This proposal proposes to introduce a new type of variable, a `Struct` (with an associated `StructDef` metadata object). The `Struct` is intended to replace the `JSON_ARR` and `JSON_OBJ` fields in the long term, and if we implement it properly (with sufficient support in the SDK-side), ideally we will have equally or even more convenient developer experience while introducing strong typing.

We will deprecate the `JSON_OBJ` and `JSON_ARR` variable types before the `1.0` release and we will remove them with `2.0` (which is not going to happen for at least 2-3 years).

## Server-Side Changes

At a high level, we will add a new type to the `VariableValue` and `TypeDefinition` messages. This type will be called `Struct` and `StructDef`, respectively. It will represent a schema for complex nested objects.

### `Struct` and `StructDef` Protobuf

```protobuf
// A Struct is a strongly-typed structure containing fields. The Struct is defined
// according to the `Schema` object.
message Struct {
  // The id of the schema.
  StructDefId struct_def_id = 1;
  // The content of the Struct
  InlineStruct struct = 2;
}

// An `InlineStruct` is a pre-validated set of fields that are part of a `Struct`.
message InlineStruct {
  // The fields in the inline struct.
  repeated StructField fields = 1;
}

// A StructField represents the value for a single field in a struct.
message StructField {
  // The value, which can be primitive or complex.
  oneof struct_value {
    // The `value` of the field is an untyped primitive `VariableValue`.
    VariableValue primitive = 1;
    // The `value` of the field is a complex `Struct`.
    InlineStruct struct = 2;
    // The `value` of the field is a list of fields.
    FieldList list = 3;
  }
  // A FieldList is a sub-structure of a `Struct`
  message FieldList {
    repeated StructField fields = 1;
  }
}

// A `SchemaFieldDef` defines a field inside a `StructDef`.
message StructFieldDef {
  // The type of the field.
  TypeDefinition field_type = 1;
  
  // The default value of the field, which should match the Field Type. If not
  // provided, then the field is treated as required.
  optional VariableValue default_value = 2;
}

// A `StructDef` is a versioned metadata object (tenant-scoped) inside LittleHorse
// that defines the structure and content of a variable value. It allows strong typing.
message StructDef {
  // The id of the `Schema`. This includes the version.
  StructDefId id = 1;

  // Optionally description of the schema.
  optional string description = 2;

  // When the `StructDef` was created.
  google.protobuf.Timestamp created_at = 3;

  // The `StructDef` defines the actual structure of any `Struct` using this `InlineStructDeff`.
  InlineStructDef struct_def = 4;
}

// An `InlineStructDef` is the actual representation of the Schema.
message InlineStructDef {
  // The fields in this schema.
  map<string, StructFieldDef> fields = 1;
}

// Unique identifier for a `StructDef`.
message StructDefId {
  // The name of the `StructDef`.
  string name = 1;

  // The version of the `StructDef`.
  int32 version = 2;
}
```

#### Inline Structs

The `InlineStruct` and `InlineStructDef` serve the purpose of allowing lightweight usage of Structs for within a `WfSpec` (meaning that we don't need to create a `StructDef` metadata getable). This is nice to allow scoping, which is a feature missing from the Task / TaskDef protocol.

#### `StructDef` Versioning

The `StructDefId` will have a `version` field. We will (by default) have strict compatibility rules for versioning a `StructDef`.

_**NOTE:** There may be a reason to make the `StructDefId` have a `major_version` and `revision` field as well, just like the `WfSpecId`, to differentiate compatible from breaking evolutions. This could potentially be done in a follow-up Proposal._

### Existing Protobuf

[PR #1412](https://github.com/littlehorse-enterprises/littlehorse/pull/1412) allows for strong typing of `ExternalEvent`s in LittleHorse. It also laid the groundwork for supporting `StructDef`s by refactoring the following proto:

* Refactors:
  * `Variable`
  * `VariableType`
  * `TaskDefOutputSchema`
* New structures:
  * `ReturnType`
  * `TypeDefinition`

This Proposal will build upon the foundation that #1412 laid.

As of now, the `TypeDefinition` looks as follows:

```proto
message TypeDefinition {
  // The basic type of the value. Will become a `oneof` once StructDef's and Struct's
  // are implemented according to issue #880.
  VariableType type = 1;

  // For compatibility purposes.
  reserved 2, 3;

  // Set to true if values of this type contain sensitive information and must be masked.
  bool masked = 4;
}
```

We will extend it to look like the following:
```proto
message TypeDefinition {
  // One of the following will be set.
  oneof defined_type {
    // A primitive type
    VariableType primitive_type = 1;

    // Refers to a `StructDef`
    StructDefId struct = 5;

    // Inline-defined Struct definition (does not refer to a Global Getable)
    InlineStructDef inline_struct = 6;
  }

  // For compatibility purposes.
  reserved 2, 3;

  // Set to true if values of this type contain sensitive information and must be masked.
  bool masked = 4;
}
```

The `VariableValue` proto will be extended as follows:

```proto
// VariableValue is a structure containing a value in LittleHorse. It can be
// used to pass input variables into a WfRun/ThreadRun/TaskRun/etc, as output
// from a TaskRun, as the value of a WfRun's Variable, etc.
message VariableValue {
  reserved 1;

  // The value held in this VariableValue. If this is unset, treat it as
  // a NULL.
  oneof value {
    // A String representing a serialized json object.
    string json_obj = 2;

    // ... Omitted ...

    // A Struct
    Struct struct = 9;
  }
}
```

The only addition is the `Struct struct = 9;` field.

Note that the `Variable`, `VariableDef`, `ThreadVarDef`, `ReturnType`, `TaskDef`, `ExternalEventDef`, `WorkflowEventDef`, `UserTaskDef`, and other protobuf structures will **not** need to change. All of the changes will be encapsulated within the `TypeDefinition` and `VariableValue` messages.

### `StructDef` Schema Evolution

At first, we will allow only Fully-Compatible schema changes:
* Add optional fields
* Add required fields with a default
* Remove optional fields.

Making a `PutStructDefRequest` with an identical `InlineStructDef` to what already exists will not cause a new Schema to be created. This follows the idempotence pattern already observed with all of our metadata Getables (including `WfSpec`, `UserTaskDef`, `TaskDef`, etc).

```proto
// Compatibility types for StructDef evolution
enum StructDefCompatibilityType {
  // No updates are allowed.
  NO_SCHEMA_UPDATES = 0;

  // Allowed to make fully compatible (both backward-and-forward compatible)
  // changes to the `struct_def` in this request.
  FULLY_COMPATIBLE = 1;
}

// Request to create a new `StructDef`.
message PutStructDefRequest {

  // The name of the `StructDef`.
  string name = 1;

  // The description of the `StructDef`.
  optional string description = 2;

  // The actual schema for the `StructDef`.
  InlineStructDef struct_def = 3;

  // If both of the following are true: <br/>
  // - A `StructDef` with the specified `name` already exists, AND <br/>
  // - The `InlineStructDef` is different <br/>
  //
  // Then the request will be accepted or rejected based on the value of the
  // allowed_updates type.
  StructDefCompatibilityType allowed_updates = 4;
}

service LittleHorse {
  // ...

  // Creates a `StructDef`. Note that this request is idempotent: if you
  // make a request to create a `StructDef` identical to the currently-created
  // one with the same `name`, no new `StructDef` will be created. This is the
  // same behavior as `rpc PutWfSpec` and `rpc PutUserTaskDef`.
  //
  // For schema evolution / compatibility rules, see the `AllowedStructDefUpdate`
  // message within the `PutStructDefRequest`.
  rpc PutStructDef(PutStructDefRequest) returns(StructDef) {}

  // Deletes a specified `StructDef`.
  rpc DeleteStructDef(StructDefId) returns(google.protobuf.Empty) {}

  // Gets a specified `StructDef`.
  rpc GetStructDef(StructDefId) returns(StructDef) {}

  // ...
}
```

I (Colt) _do not like_ the idea of relaxing the allowed update types to introduce minorly-breaking changes in the `StructDef`. The reasons for this are beyond the scope of this proposal. However, I have designed the `PutStructDefRequest` to allow extending it to relax those compatibility restrictions if needed in the future.

#### Validating `StructDef` Schema Evolution

In addition to allowing users to set a compatibility type to be validated when putting a `StructDef`, we will also provide `StructDef` validation through a separate RPC: `RPC ValidateStructDef`.

`RPC ValidateStructDef` will perform the same compatibility checks used in `RPC PutStructDef`, but without the intent of putting a `StructDef` to the server. This make the server a useful single source of truth for checking compatibility when designing `StructDef`s.

```proto
// Request to compare a new `StructDef` against an existing `StructDef` based on a compatibility type.
message ValidateStructDefRequest {
  // The name of the `StructDef` you want to compare against that already exists on the server.
  string name = 1;

  // The new `StructDef` schema.
  InlineStructDef struct_def = 2;


  // The server will validate the new StructDef schema against
  // the existing StructDef schema based on this compatibility type.
  StructDefCompatibilityType compatibility_type = 3;
}

// Response containing information about whether or not a new `StructDef` is compatible with an existing `StructDef`.
message ValidateStructDefResponse {
  bool is_compatible = 0;

  // This message leaves room for returning additional information about the validation,
  // like what `StructFieldDef` evolution(s) are invaild and why.
}

service LittleHorse {
  // ...
  
  // Validate the schema of a new `StructDef` against an existing `StructDef`
  rpc ValidateStructDef(ValidateStructDefRequest) returns (ValidateStructDefResponse) {}

  // ...
}
```

### Interoperability with `JSON_OBJ`

Our conversion policy will be that we can convert a `Struct` to a `JSON_OBJ`, but we do not allow converting a `JSON_OBJ` to a `Struct`. For example:

* If a `WfSpec` passes a `Struct` into a `TaskDef` that expects a `JSON_OBJ`, the Server will automatically convert the `ScheduledTask`'s appropriate `VariableValue` to a `JSON_OBJ`.
* We will reject attempts to create a `WfSpec` that passes in a `JSON_OBJ` value into a `TaskDef` that expects a `Struct`.

Consider the following Java:

```java
class Car {
  String make;
  String model;
}

// the worker class
public class MyWorker {
    @LHTaskMethod("something-with-car")
    public void foo(Car car) {
        System.out.println(car.make);
    }
}
```

In the past, this only worked if the variable on the ScheduledTask was of the type `JSON_OBJ`. This ADR proposes that the variable should work if either of the following are true:
1. The variable in the ScheduledTask is type JSON_OBJ and can be deserialized into a Car, OR
2. The variable in the ScheduledTask is a Struct that matches.

This means that the SDK will dynamically convert the `VariableValue` into a `Car` whether it is a `STRUCT` or a `JSON_OBJ`.


## Client-Side Enhancements

We want to make it just as _fast_ to work with `Struct`s as it is to work with `JSON_OBJ` variables. This means that we need to support automatic `StructDef` / `InlineStructDef` creation within our SDK's to make it so that users do not need to manually build the `StructDef` protobuf.

Additionally, users complain about the difficulty of having to register metadata (eg. `ExternalEventDef`, `UserTaskDef`, `WorkflowEventDef`) before registering the `WfSpec`. We want to make it

This proposal shows how the behavior will work with the `sdk-java`. I believe the other three SDK's can be addressed in one (or three) follow-up proposals.

### Task Workers

Task Workers will be able to deal with `StructDef`s in two ways:

1. Refer to the `StructDefId` of a `Struct` that already exists.
2. Create their own `StructDef` using reflection.

#### `StructDef` References

We will extend the `LHType` annotation to allow specifying a `StructDefId`. Additionally Consider the following Java:

```java
class Car {
    String make;
    String model;
}

class MyWorker {
    @LHTaskMethod("something-with-car-struct")
    public void doSomethingWithStruct(@LHType(structDefName = "car") Struct car) {
        // car is the LH proto `Struct`
    }

    @LHTaskMethod("something-with-car-object")
    public void doSomethingWithCar(@LHType(structDefName = "car") Car car) {
        // car is deserialized into a `Car` POJO
    }
}
```

In the above code, the `LHTaskWorker#registerTaskDef()` and `LHTaskWorker#start()` methods would throw an error if:

1. The `car` `StructDef` does not exist.
2. The `car` `StructDef` is incompatible with the `Car` object (only in the second case above).

#### Automatic `StructDef` Creation

The `LHTaskWorker` should be extended to allow automatically creating a `StructDef` as per the following code:

```java
@LHStructDef(name = "car")
class Car {
    @LHStructField(required = true)
    String make;

    @LHStructField(required = false)
    String model;
}

class MyWorker {
    @LHTaskMethod("something-with-car")
    public void doSomethingWithStruct(Car car) {
        // The `registerTaskDef()` method will create a `StructDef` first.
    }
}
```

### Creating `VariableValue`s

It should be easy to create a `VariableValue` of type `STRUCT` using our SDK's. We will provide two mechanisms. Note again that this is the Java proposal; other SDK's will follow shortly after.

#### Using an `@LHStruct` Annotated Class

Let's say I have the following Java class which is used to create a `StructDef`:

```java
@LHStructDef(name = "car")
class Car {
    @LHStructField(required = true)
    String make;

    @LHStructField(required = false)
    String model;
}
```

I should be able to do the following:

```java
Car carPojo = ...;
LHconfig config = ...;

VariableValue carVariableValue = LHLibUtil.objToStruct(carPojo, config);
```

The `LHLibUtil#objToStruct` method should fetch the `StructDef` from the Server and validate that the current POJO is compatible with it. If it is not commpatible, an `Exception` will be thrown.

_(NOTE: We can extend the `LHConfig` to cache `StructDef`s to improve performance, but that may not be popular among the LH Grumpy Maintainers.)_

#### Using a Struct Name

We should also support the following. Note that there is no `LHStruct` annotation on the `Car`.

```java
class Car {
    String make;
    String model;
}
```

Create a `Variablevalue`:
```java
Car carPojo = ...;
LHconfig config = ...;

VariableValue carVariableValue = LHLibUtil.objToStruct(carPojo, config, "car");
```

### The `WfSpec` DSL

We should make it easy to work with `Struct`s and `StructDef`s in the `WfSpec` SDK.


#### Using and Creating `StructDef`s

Regarding the creation of `StructDef`s inside the `Workflow` utility class:
* It will be common for a `WfSpec` to accept `Struct`s as input variables.
* If a `WfSpec` is passing a `Struct` into a `TaskRun`, then it is fair to assume that the `StructDef` already exists, because otherwise the `TaskDef` couldn't exist.

#### Accessing Sub-Structures

Note that `Struct`s are nested object structures. You can have a field inside a `Struct` whose type is a completely separate `StructDef`. For example:

```java
@LHStructDef(name = "car")
class Car {
    @LHStructField(required = true)
    public String make;

    @LHStructField(required = false)
    public String model;
}

@LHStructDef(name = "person")
class Person {
    @LHStructField(required = true)
    public String name;

    @LHStructField(required = true)
    public List<Car> cars;
}
```

This is useful, because we can have a `TaskDef` that takes in a `car` Struct. Let's see how this might work:

```java
public void wfLogic(WorkflowThread wf) {

    WfRunVariable myPerson = wf.declareStructVar("my-person", Person.class);
    WfRunVariable carValue = wf.declareDouble("car-value");

    carValue.assign(wf.execute("calculate-price-of-car", myPerson.get("car")));
}
```

Note that the `.get()` should be recursive: it should allow fetching sub-fields.

Additionally, the `Workflow#registerWfSpec()` method should create the `person` `StructDef` using reflection from the `Person` java class.

## Further Discussion

The information above should be sufficient to get a working implementation done in Java. However, I wanted to make some notes.

### Deprecating JSON_OBJ?

I do not like `JSON_OBJ` at all. However, we have real users using `JSON_OBJ` and as such cannot pull the rug out from under it (even though we are before 1.0). A proper deprecation and removal strategy is beyond the scope of this Proposal; however, once this Proposal is implemented we will be in a position to fully support both `Struct` and `JSON_OBJ` types (and they will be partially interoperable).

### External Events?

This proposal does not _directly_ discuss External Events. That is not an oversight: the `ExternalEventDef` contains a `TypeDefinition` so it will automatically inherit `Struct` capabilities.

### Implementation and Performance

Since this proposal is very API-driven rather than performance-driven, there arenâ€™t many implementation details that are worthy of being noted in the proposal. However, some notes:

* We will need to make sure that any schema validation happening inside a `Command#process()` call is very fast.
* We want to avoid json deserialization as much as possible. This is part of the motivation for not using JSONSchema.

### Testing

We will write end to end tests.

### Further Work

Some further work includes:

* Differentiate between breaking and compatible evolutions in the `StructDefId` by following the `WfSpecId` pattern.
* **Important**: Follow-up proposal that shows how this will work with the other three SDK's (Python, Go, C#).
* Plugins and wrappers that allow converting well-known schema formats (eg. Protobuf, Avro, JsonSchema) into LittleHorse `Struct`s and `StructDef`s.
