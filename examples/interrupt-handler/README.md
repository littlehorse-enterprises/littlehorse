## Running InterruptHandlerExample

This example shows how to interrupt a workflow execution.
You need to register and interrupt handler with thread.registerInterruptHandler.

In this example the parent thread sleeps 30 sec, we can interrupt it while it's sleeping,
and it creates a child thread. When an interruption is received the workflow executes the task:
"some-task", if the task fails the whole workflow fails.

In order for the Interrupt to happen, the parent thread needs to be sleeping.

Let's run the example in `InterruptHandlerExample.java`

```
./gradlew example-interrupt-handler:run
```

In another terminal, use `lhctl` to run the workflow:

```
# Run a new workflow
lhctl run example-interrupt-handler

# Take the resulting workflow ID, and do:
lhctl get wfRun <wf run id>

# Note that it is 'RUNNING'. Next, post an external event using the following:
lhctl postEvent <wf run id> interruption-event NULL

# Then inspect the wfRun:
# Note that the threadRuns number 1 is 'ERROR' with type 'INTERRUPT'
lhctl get wfRun <wf run id>

# Then you can inspect the output of the ExternalEvent:
lhctl get nodeRun <wf run id> 1 1
lhctl get taskRun <wf run id> <task runid>
```
